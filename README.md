## Information

#### About
RaptorClient is a Minecraft Forge "Utility Mod" for anarchy-related servers such as 2b2t.

Feel free to contribute and join the official discord by clicking the shield above.

Most notable features:
* Custom combat modules
* Viewmodel changer
* Custom renderings that are compatible with other mods such as future
* Clean GUI and stable config
* Unique HUD components that are comparable to ones seen in paid clients.

#### Credits
***Check specific class files for full credits.***
This client started out based off of FINZ0's Osiris, which in turn was based off of 086's KAMI.
Without these projects, RaptorClient would not exist so a lot of credit is due to them for their work.

This client also implements the ClickGUI using PanelStudio: https://github.com/lukflug/PanelStudio/.
it also uses many Gamesense Code or you can say its GS+
If you believe that we are using your code and credits are not properly given, please message RitomG#6969 on Discord.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation
1. RaptorClient requires Minecraft v1.12.2 Forge to run. You can download that here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/.
2. Once forge is installed, download the latest release from the releases page or from the discord.
3. Navigate to your Minecraft folder (%appdata%/.minecraft).
4. If this does not already exist, create a folder titled `mods` and with another folder inside titled `1.12.2`.
5. Drag the release jar into the `1.12.2` folder.
6. Launch the game using your Forge profile (created in step 1).
